# BidgoliGradeCalc
This is a shitty console-based grade calculator that was created because of a CS professor who refuses to post online grades.

# How to Use
When you first enter the program, it will prompt you to either enter a grade or view the grade history. The grade history is pretty self-explanatory, it is the history of grades that is stored in a file and are used to calculate total course percentage.

If you choose to enter a grade, you will be asked to enter your recieved grade and the max possible grade. After that, your total grade percentage and letter grade, including your newly entered grade, will appear. You will then be given the option to re-enter that grade. If you choose not to re-enter it, you will be asked if you want to enter another grade. If you choose not to, the program will terminate.

If you choose to view the grade history, everything saved in the grade history will appear line by line, followed by the overall course percentage and letter grade. Then, the program ask you if you want to erase the grade history. After that, you will be given the option to enter a new grade. If you choose to, it will redirect you to grade entry. Otherwise, the program will terminate.

This project is a work in progress and is very likely to have bugs. If you find one, please report it, and I will try my best to fix it (I'm only a beginner level programmer, give me some slack).
